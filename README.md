## Installation

Use `npm run client-install` to install client dependecies.
Use `npm install` to install server dependecies.

You will need to rename `sample.env` file to just `.env` and supply your own mongodb driver url to work with the database.

To start the server, run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`

Work in progress..
